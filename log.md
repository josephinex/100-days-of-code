### Day 15: August 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Querydsl fixes and setup. 

**Thoughts:** 
To use querydsl to generate Qclasses:
- Add apt-maven-plugin to pom.xml<br/>
- Processor should be set to com.mysema.query.apt.QuerydslAnnotationProcessor, if you want it to find @QueryEntity. It won't work with other processor, unless you use a simple JPA @Entity.<br/>
- Annotate your classes with @QueryEntity<br/>
- Apt Maven plugin has issues with Eclipse, so it's not possible to use it directly from this IDE. Instead use mvn generate-sources in terminal.<br/>
